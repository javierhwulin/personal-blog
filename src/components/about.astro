      Hi, I'm Javier Hengda. I write about design, technology, and the
      intersection of simplicity and functionality in digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is built with a content-first philosophyâ€”every design decision
      is made to enhance readability and focus attention on the ideas being
      shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not writing, you can find me exploring new design patterns,
      contributing to open source projects, or reading about the future of
      human-computer interaction. I'm also a big fan of minimalism and
      simplicity.
